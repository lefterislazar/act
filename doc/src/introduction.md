# Introduction

<!-- act is a high level specification language for evm programs. The core aim is to allow for easy
refinement. We want to make it as easy as possible for development teams to define a high level
specification, which can then either be used "upwards" to prove higher level properties or
"downwards" to demonstrate that an implementation in EVM bytecode conforms to the spec. -->

<!-- act currently integrates with the following tools:

- Hevm: automated refinement proof between the act spec and a given evm bytecode object
- SMT: automated proof of invariants and postconditions
- Rocq: manual proof of high level properties against a model derived from the act spec -->


<!-- Sophie's text -->
act is a high-level specification language for EVM programs. That means act captures the nature of Ethereum smart contracts - which compile to EVM bytecode - as their specification. act is designed in a way that allows for easy refinement of a contract and its specification. This property together with it's built-in formal verification backends makes act a powerful tool for smart contract developers.

The goal of act is to make it as easy as possible for development teams to define a high-level
specification, which can either be used 
1. to prove an implementation in EVM bytecode conforms to the spec, or <!--  don't like the wording: bc users can in fact just provide the .sol/.vy code -->
2. to prove its higher-level properties.

A more detailed explanation of act's formal verification backends together with examples can be found in **Verification with act** sections.

To **get started** with act, you can follow the installation instructions in the [Getting Started and Installation](./installation.md) section.

## act Verification Pipeline

act provides two main verification backends that work with the same specification:

**HEVM Backend**: Automatically proves that EVM bytecode (compiled from Solidity or Vyper) correctly implements the act specification. It uses symbolic execution to explore all possible execution paths and SMT solvers (CVC5, Z3, or Bitwuzla) to verify equivalence.

**Rocq Backend**: Exports the specification as a formal transition system to the Rocq proof assistant (formerly Coq), enabling manual proofs of arbitrarily complex properties about the contract's behavior.

<!-- have ERC20 example already here? -->

Further key capabilities of act:
<!-- mention formally defined semantics + type safety + soundness -->
- **The semantics of act is fully formally defined.** Type safety and soundness are proven in detail. <span style="color:green">A full tech report will be available shortly.</span>
<!-- talk about language agnostics -->
- **act is language agnostic**: Conceptually, act could support conformity of spec and implementation written in all programming languages that compile to EVM bytecode. Currently (in v0.2.0), Solidity and Vyper are supported.
<!-- loops  -->
- **act exhaustively describes a contract's behavior.** To do so, symbolic execution is used. For symbolic execution to be sound unbounded loops cannot be supported.
<!-- and aliasing -->
- **act achieves a purely functional interpretation of a contract's specification** (in a sound way, for contracts without aliasing). This can be accomplished if the *storage of the contract does not contain any aliased reference to another contract*. Hence, aliasing of contract names is not allowed in act: this unique ownership property is verified automatically for act specifications using symbolic execution and SMT solving.





<!-- ## Types

The types of act consist of three basic primitives: Integers, Booleans and Bytestrings. Integers are
unbounded, with true integer operations. However, as our integer expressions will often represent
words in the EVM, we allow ourselves a slight abuse of notation and denote by uintN/intN integers
together with the constraint that the value fits into a uintN/intN. If any operation could over- or
underflow this bound, the constraint will be unfulfilled and the specification will fail to prove.

Using conventional ABI types for typing also allows us to specify function signatures in a concise
way. As an example, consider this specification of a trivial contract that adds two numbers and
stores the result on chain:

```
constructor of Add
interface constructor()

creates

  uint result := 0

transition add of Add
interface add(uint x, uint y)

iff in range uint

   x + y

storage

  result => x + y

returns x + y
```

Expressed in English and math, this specification would read:

The contract `Add` has a single state variable, named `result`, which is an integer such that `0 <= result < 2^256`.

Given any pair of integers `x` and `y`, s.t. `0 <= x < 2^256` and `0 <= y < 2^256`, an ABI encoded call to the contract `Add` with the signature `add(uint256,uint256)`, with its respective arguments named `x` and `y`, will:

- store `x + y` in `result` and return `x + y` if `0 <= x + y < 2^256`
- revert otherwise
