# Transitions and Storage Updates

Transitions in act specify the behavior of contract functions and the conditions under which storage is updated or values are returned.

## Transition Structure

The general shape of a transition that returns a value in act is:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  transition <name> (<parameters>) ?payable : <return_type>   │
└─────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                          │
                          ▼
                  ┌───────────────--┐
                  │ iff <condition> │
                  └────────┬────────┘
                           │
              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
              │                         │
              |                         |
      No branching                Branching (cases)

    ┌──────────────────┐                 ▼
    │ returns <value>  │      ┌──────────────────────┐
    └──────────────────┘      │ returns <value>      │
                              └──────────┬───────────┘
                                         │
                                         ▼
                                        ...

                                         │
                                         ▼
                              ┌──────────────────────┐
                              │ case <condition>:    │
                              │   updates <storage>  │
                              └──────────┬───────────┘
                                         │
                                         ▼
                              ┌──────────────────────┐
                              │ returns <value>      │
                              └──────────────────────┘
```

The general shape of a transition that does **not return** a value in act is:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     transition <name> (<parameters>) ?payable                │
└─────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘

                          ▼
                  ┌───────────────--┐
                  │ iff <condition> │
                  └────────┬────────┘
                           │
              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
              │                         │

                                        ...

```


**Components:**

1. **Transition Head**: `transition <name> (<parameters>) ?payable  ?(: <return_type>)`
   - Function name `<name>` and parameter list `<parameters>` with types and names.
   - Optional `payable` keyword to mark transitions that accept Ether.
   - Optional return type specification (e.g., `: uint256`). If a return type is specified, the transition must include a `returns <value>` statement after each `updates` block.

2. **Precondition Block**: `iff <condition>`
   - Specifies the necessary and sufficient condition for successful execution.
   - Can be omitted if there are no preconditions.
   - If the precondition fails, the transition reverts and makes no state changes.

3. **Cases Block** (optional):
   - If present two or more `case <condition>: updates <storage>` branches.
   - Conditions must be mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
   - Each case describes storage updates (state transitions) for a particular execution path.
   - The absence of a cases block is equivalent to a single implicit `case true:` block.

4. **Updates Block**: `updates <storage>`
   - Updates storage variables based on the current execution path (i.e. the case).
   - Storage fields that are not mentioned remain unchanged.
   - The updates are separated by newlines and have the shape: `<variable> := <expression>`
   - Updates are **simultaneous**: all right-hand sides are evaluated in the initial state. 
   - Can be skipped if no storage updates are performed.

5. **Returns Block**: `returns <value>`
   - present after each `updates` block if and only if the transition has a return type.
   - Specifies the return value of the function.


## Transition Signatures
Each externally callable function of the EVM smart contract source is specified as a transition. Similarly to constructors, transitions can be marked `payable` or non-payable (the default). Similarly to the constructors, for transitions that are not marked payable, act automatically internally adds a precondition that `CALLVALUE == 0`.


For example the `transfer` transition of the ERC20 contract is non-payable and specified as:

*(signature from [erc20.act](https://github.com/argotorg/act/blob/main/tests/hevm/pass/multisource/erc20/erc20.act))*

```act
transition transfer(uint256 _value, address to) : bool
     ...
```

This declares the function parameters and the return type `bool`.

The other transitions of the ERC20 contract are:

*(signatures from [erc20.act](https://github.com/argotorg/act/blob/main/tests/hevm/pass/multisource/erc20/erc20.act))*

```act
transition transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint amount) : bool
       ...
transition approve(address spender, uint256 amount) : bool
   ...
transition burn(uint256 amount) : bool
   ...
transition burnFrom(address src, uint256 amount) : bool
   ...
transition mint(address dst, uint256 amount) : bool
   ...
transition totalSupply() : uint256
   ...
transition balanceOf(address owner) : uint256
   ...
transition allowance(address owner, address spender) : uint256
   ...
```

The transitions correspond to the externally callable functions of the ERC20 contract:

*(signatures from [erc20.sol](https://github.com/argotorg/act/blob/main/tests/hevm/pass/multisource/erc20/erc20.sol))*
```solidity
function transfer(uint256 value, address to) public returns (bool) {
   ...
}
function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint amount) public returns (bool) {
   ...
}
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
   ...
}
function burn(uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
   ...
}
function burnFrom(address src, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
   ...
}
function mint(address dst, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
   ...
}
```

The transitions `totalSupply`, `balanceOf` and `allowance` correspond to the public getter functions automatically generated by Solidity for the respective public storage variables.

## Transition Preconditions
Similar to constructors, see [Constructor Preconditions](./constructors.md#constructor-preconditions) for details.

## Case Splits and Control Flow
act uses `case` blocks to describe control flow explicitly.
In the ERC20 `transfer` transition, we distinguish two cases based on whether the sender (`CALLER`) is transferring tokens to themselves or to another address:

*(transfer transition from [erc20.act](https://github.com/argotorg/act/blob/main/tests/hevm/pass/multisource/erc20/erc20.act))*

```act
transition transfer(uint256 _value, address to) : bool

iff
   ...

case CALLER != to:

  updates

   balanceOf := balanceOf[
                CALLER => balanceOf[CALLER] - _value,
                to     => balanceOf[to]     + _value ]

  returns true

case CALLER == to:

  returns true
```
If the sender is transferring to another address (`CALLER != to`), the balances of both the sender and the recipient are updated accordingly. If the sender is transferring to themselves (`CALLER == to`), no storage updates are happening, and the transition simply returns `1`.
This separation is necessary because act updates are **non-sequential**: all updates refer to the pre-state. Writing the cases explicitly avoids ambiguity. Details on updates are explained next.


## Storage Updates Are Simultaneous

Storage updates are not a sequence of assignments, but rather a set of equations that must hold on the final state. Therefore, updates are simultaneous: all right-hand sides refer to the initial state and all left-hand sides are storage slots that are modified by the transition.

Consider the "standard" case of the ERC20 `transferFrom` transition:

*(snippet from [erc20.act](https://github.com/argotorg/act/blob/main/tests/hevm/pass/multisource/erc20/erc20.act), transferFrom transition)*

```act
case src != dst and CALLER != src and allowance[src][CALLER] < 2^256 - 1:

   updates
   balanceOf := balanceOf[
                  src => balanceOf[src] - amount,
                  dst   => balanceOf[dst]   + amount ]

   allowance := allowance[
                  src => allowance[src][
                           CALLER => allowance[src][CALLER] - amount ]]
```

This does not mean adapt `balanceOf` first and `allowance` second.
Instead, it means:
“In the final state, the mapping `balanceOf` equals the old one except the fields `from` and `to` where updated, and `allowance` equals the old mapping except `from` now maps to a different mapping (the one from before except `CALLER` maps to `allowance[from][CALLER] - _value`).”
All right-hand sides are evaluated in the **initial state**.
This design avoids accidental order-dependence and makes transitions suitable for formal reasoning.

Note that if the **balance in Ether** of a contract changes during a transition (e.g., in a payable transition), this has to be reflected in the `updates` block by updating the special variable `BALANCE` accordingly.

## Storage Updates Are Partially Ordered

In general, the updates block can be arranged in any order, as all updates are simultaneous.
There is, however, one subtlety to be aware of: if a storage slot is updated and also a specific field of that slot is updated, 
the more general references have to be listed before the specific ones.

The **most common scenario** where this arises is when a contract has another contract `other_contract_instance` in its storage, and both the entire contract and a specific field `some_field` of it are updated in the same `updates` block:
- `other_contract_instance := <constr_other_contract>(<constr_parameters>)` (general update) has to happen before
- `other_contract_instance.some_field := <expression>` (specific field update).

Let's illustrate this with a motivated example. We first define a simple contract `Admins` that tracks two admin addresses. This contract will be used in another contract `Asset` below to show the ordering requirement.


```act
contract Admins

constructor(address _admin1)
iff true

creates
   address admin1 := _admin1
   address admin2 := ORIGIN

transition set_admin2(address new_admin2)
iff true
updates
   admin2 := new_admin2

...
```
 
 `Admins` is a simple contract that tracks two admin addresses. The first admin is set during construction, while the second admin is initialized to the transaction origin (`ORIGIN`). We assume that only admin2 can be externally updated via the `admin2` transition. (That means in the solidity equivalent, `admin1` would be immutable and `admin2` would have a setter function.)


```act
contract Asset

constructor(uint256 _value)
iff true
creates
    uint256 _value := _value
    Admins admins := new Admins(CALLER)
    mapping(address => uint256) balanceOf := [THIS => _value]



transition assetTransfer(uint256 amt, address to) : bool

iff CALLER == admins.admin1 or CALLER == admins.admin2
    inRange(uint256, balanceOf[THIS] - amt)
    THIS != to ==> inRange(uint256, balanceOf[to] + amt)

case THIS != to

updates
   balanceOf := balanceOf[
                  THIS => balanceOf[THIS] - amt,
                  to   => balanceOf[to]   + amt ]

returns true

case THIS == to

returns true


transition setAdmins(address new_admin1, address new_admin2)

iff true

case CALLER == admins.admin1 or CALLER == admins.admin2

updates
   admins := new Admins(new_admin1)
   admins.admin2 := new_admin2

case not (CALLER == admins.admin1 or CALLER == admins.admin2)

...
```
*(This example has been added to the benchmarks as [ordered_updates.act](https://github.com/argotorg/act/blob/main/tests/hevm/pass/ordered_updates/ordered_updates.act) and can be proven equivalent to the corresponding [ordered_updates.sol](https://github.com/argotorg/act/blob/main/tests/hevm/pass/ordered_updates/ordered_updates.sol) implementation.)*

*(Note: the trivial precondition blocks (`iff true`) could be omitted for brevity.)*

Let's consider now the `Asset` contract above. 
 - The contract `Asset` is a variation of a drastically simplified token contract (similar to ERC20). 
 - The relevant difference is that only the two admin addresses can transfer tokens from the contract's own balance to other addresses. (See the `assetTransfer` transition.) 
 - The `Admins` contract (introduced above) is used to track the two admin addresses. (See the constructor of `Asset`.)
 - There is an extra transition `setAdmins` that allows either admin to update both admin addresses.
 
 **Ordered Updates**

  Consider the `setAdmins` transition, where in the first case `case CALLER == admins.admin1 or CALLER == admins.admin2` both admin addresses are updated. We are in the situation described earlier: there is a **general update of a storage slot** and afterwards a **specific field of that slot** is updated:
   - `admins := new Admins(new_admin1)` (general update)
   - `admins.admin2 := new_admin2` (specific field update)
  
This ordering is necessary to ensure that the updates have unambiguous semantics. 
Otherwise the general update would "rewrite" the specific field update, making
the specification of that field obsolete and potentially confusing. 
The references on the left-hand side of the equations are evaluated sequentially, such that
potentially newly created contract addresses can also be reached when updating 
a specific field of such contract: that means the right-hand side of the second update `admins.admin2 := new_admin2` refers to the updated value of `admins` from the first update.

This ordering is part of act's type system: a specification violating this property would raise an error during type checking.

 <!-- If we had written the specific field update first, it would have referred to the old value of `admins`, which is not what we want.

This is a design choice in act to ensure updated storage references are well-defined.
Imagine if we had written the updates in the opposite order:

```act
updates
   admins.admin2 := new_admin2
   admins := Admins(new_admin1)
``` -->


<!-- transition foo(uint256 newSupply, address to, uint256 value)

iff 
  inRange(uint256, newSupply - value)

case CALLER != to :

updates

   token := Token(newSupply) 
   token.balanceOf := token.balanceOf[
                        CALLER => newSupply - value,
                        to     => value ]

``` -->
